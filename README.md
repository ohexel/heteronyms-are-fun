# Heteronyms are fun
[Heteronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_(linguistics)) in English, French, and German. No pretension to exhaustivity (quantitative or qualitative), just the ones that I find amusing or annoying. Some (most) are not even exact heteronyms but (in my opinion) are confusing to non-native speakers.

## English
bow/prow - the forward part of a boat/ship

row - row the boat; a row in a table

row - an argument


plough - a former sword

though - however, despite that

tough - difficult, hard


## French
Just because inconsistency is the name of the game, here are some fun homophones (same pronunciation) that are heterographs (different spelling):

ver - worm

vert - green

vers - verse

vers - toward

verre - glass

vair - (obsolete) hard to explain, here is a [picture](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit-gris_(%C3%A9cureuil))
